One, two, three times
We fell in love
One, two, three times
You broke my heart

Too many times
I look above
Thinking of you

Get you on your back huh[?] feeling bold
A little romance bares the soul
A little time to languish
Fiery feelings, feed them with anguish

One, two, three times
We fell in love
One, two, three times
You broke my heart

Cause its my master vision
Complex plays played with precision
Tough man making tough decisions
And everybody should stop and listen now

All these things
While all these things
While all these things
While all these things
While all these things
Have caused caused collisions
Not part of the master vision

All these things

We fell in love
One, two, three times
You broke my heart

Too many times
I look above
Thinking of you

When will it come true

Enter the endless story
Too much of anything's boring
The sum of us is multiplying
Subtract and divide to pass the time
